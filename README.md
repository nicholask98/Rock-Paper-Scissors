# Rock-Paper-Scissors
 Text-Based game written in python

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

## Remember the rules:

* Rock beats scissors
* Scissors beats paper
* Paper beats rock

### Completion update
I used a dictionary to reference comparisons and a while loop with a sentinel value input from the user to restart the game. Now it can be played on loop. Invalid selections are detected by the user inputs not existing in the comparisons dictionary.
